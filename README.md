# DigitalClock
A full screen digital clock using pygame.

I have a RaspberryPi with official Screen which otherwise just sits on the console without starting Xorg. It would otherwise be a headless server and normally the screen is powersaved.
I thought I would take advantage of the screen and make it into a digital clock directly from the console using the Linux framebuffer.

This is my first project using pygame and intended to be just a interesting little side project to learn a few new things.
If anyone else likes it and wants to improve it, feel free to fork it and build upon it.
